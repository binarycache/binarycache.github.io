 Hi, this is Anmol. I am a research scholar doing joint PhD at University of Groningen, Netherlands and IIT Roorkee, India. I work under the supervision of Dr. Partha Pratim Roy, Dr. M.K. Van Vugt and Dr. Niels Taatgen. The topic of my PhD is "Tracking Depression and Elucidating its Mechanisms using Cognitive Neuroscience, EEG, and Machine Learning". It is part of a project approved in the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Collaboration (SPARC) by MHRD.
 My work includes <mark>Deep Learning</mark>,  <mark> Computational Cognitive Neuroscience </mark> and   <mark>Cognitive Modelling</mark>

          We classified age and gender of a person based on the baseline EEG Recordings. An industry standard EEG recording device has been used to record cerebral activities of 60 subjects (both male and female) in relaxed position with closed eyes. Deep BLSTM-LSTM network has been used to construct a hybrid learning framework for the classification. We achieved and accuracy of 93.7% and 97.5% for age and gender classification respectively. Our analysis also reveals that the beta band frequencies are better in predicting the age and gender as compared to other frequency bands of the EEG signals.

          Comparing the underlying mechanisms of reward learning and spontaneous thoughts in detecting depression. A cross-national study in India and the USA.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            We collected data of 61 participants from India and USA while they were doing the reward learning and spontaneous thinking tasks. We observed that dreward learning is a better phenotype for dignosing depression and there are significant demographic factors that affect the prognosis of depression and closely related constructs like Rumination and Perseverative Thinking.

          Depression Detection with EEG data and studying the effects of meditation on Depression.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            We collected EEG data of 27 Depressed patients before and after meditation (RajaYoga) from KGMC hospital, Karnal. The objective was to observe the before and after differences of meditation on depression and classifying it. We got promising results in differences between the connectivity matrices (DTF) before and after the meditation. The results indicate that decreased activity in the frontal areas of brain. Together with the decreaed questionnaire scores (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)) and the decreased frontal activity, it can be concluded that the mediation actually helped the depressed patients. We are still working on building the classifier.

          Compared reinforcement learning algorithms; Q-learning and Instance Based Learning. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            We proposed cognitive models like PyIBL as an alternative approach to reinforcement learning. Did a comparison of PyIBL and Q-Learning on FrozenLake environment from OpenAI gym. The results suggest that PyIBL was able to outperform Q-learning in generalizing to a new environment and also took less training time in doing so. (Paper Submitted to IEEE Access)
