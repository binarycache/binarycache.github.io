 Hi, this is Anmol. I am a research scholar doing joint PhD at University of Groningen, Netherlands and IIT Roorkee, India. I work under the supervision of Dr. Partha Pratim Roy, Dr. M.K. Van Vugt and Dr. Niels Taatgen. The topic of my PhD is "Tracking Depression and Elucidating its Mechanisms using Cognitive Neuroscience, EEG, and Machine Learning". It is part of a project approved in the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Collaboration (SPARC) by MHRD.
 My work includes <mark>Deep Learning</mark>,  <mark> Computational Cognitive Neuroscience </mark> and   <mark>Cognitive Modelling</mark>

          We classified age and gender of a person based on the baseline EEG Recordings. An industry standard EEG recording device has been used to record cerebral activities of 60 subjects (both male and female) in relaxed position with closed eyes. Deep BLSTM-LSTM network has been used to construct a hybrid learning framework for the classification. We achieved and accuracy of 93.7% and 97.5% for age and gender classification respectively. Our analysis also reveals that the beta band frequencies are better in predicting the age and gender as compared to other frequency bands of the EEG signals.

          Comparing the underlying mechanisms of reward learning and spontaneous thoughts in detecting depression. A cross-national study in India and the USA.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            We collected data of 61 participants from India and USA while they were doing the reward learning and spontaneous thinking tasks. We observed that dreward learning is a better phenotype for dignosing depression and there are significant demographic factors that affect the prognosis of depression and closely related constructs like Rumination and Perseverative Thinking.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
